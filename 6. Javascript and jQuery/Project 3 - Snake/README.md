A Snake game with extra features that I made for The Odin Project. There are still more features to be added in the future

* Hitting a tree or a giant blade trap will also lead to Game Over
* A new landscape is generated every time you start a new game
* Each new game comes with a random number of random types of trees
* When starting a world, there is a 50% chance that a Giant Blade Trap will be spawned
* The giant blade trap moves clockwise from corner to corner
* The giant blade trap will destroy any tree segments in it's way
* Ability to get Achievements
* An achievement list which is displayed after pressing the button on top on Game Over
* A scoreboard and a restart button

# [Snake - More like Mini Moldorm](https://cdn.rawgit.com/magfurulabeer/the_odin_project/master/2.%20Web%20Development%20101/etch-a-sketch/index.html)
A Snake game with extra features that I made for The Odin Project. There are still more features to be added in the future

## Features
* Regular snake functionality
* A new landscape every time you start a new world
* Each new game comes with it's own obstacles (At the moment, only trees)
* Ability to get and see Achievements
* A scoreboard and a restart button

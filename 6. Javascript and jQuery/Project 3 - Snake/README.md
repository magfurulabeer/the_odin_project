A Snake game with extra features that I made for The Odin Project. There are still more features to be added in the future

## Features
* Moveable sprite who gains one tail segment after eating prey
* Every time you eat, there is a 15% chance a heart will appear
* Hearts will only stay for 5 seconds before they poof away
* Hearts cut your tail length by 5
* Going out of bounds leads to Game Over
* Hitting a tree or a giant blade trap will also lead to Game Over
* A new landscape is generated every time you start a new game
* Each new game comes with a random number of random types of trees
* When starting a world, there is a 50% chance that a Giant Blade Trap will be spawned
* The giant blade trap moves clockwise from corner to corner
* The giant blade trap will destroy any tree segments in it's way
* Ability to get Achievements
* An achievement list which is displayed after pressing the button on top on Game Over
* A scoreboard and a restart button
* Music, sounds, and a mute button (NOTE: Mute button currently does not work in FireFox)

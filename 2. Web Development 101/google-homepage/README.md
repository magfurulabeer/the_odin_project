# Google Homepage
A static clone of the google homepage I made for The Odin Project.
This project has no functionality. It is only a cosmetic copy.

## Project: HTML/CSS
* Start with just putting the main elements on the page (the logo image and search form), then get them placed horizontally. You can either download the Google logo or link directly to its URL on the web in your <img> tag.
* Next do the navbar across the top, first building the content and then trying to position it. Check out how to build a horizontal CSS navbar if you're lost.
* Finally, put in the footer, which should be very similar to the top navbar.
* In general, do as much on your own as you can before relying on the developer tools (or viewing the page's source code) to help you along.

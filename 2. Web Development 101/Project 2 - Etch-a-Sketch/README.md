# [Sketch-A-Etch](https://cdn.rawgit.com/magfurulabeer/the_odin_project/master/2.%20Web%20Development%20101/etch-a-sketch/index.html)
A Etch-A-Sketch and normal Sketchpad hybrid I made for The Odin Project.

## Features
* You can color a square by putting your mouse on it
* You can choose between 5 basic colors (blue,green,yellow,orange,red)
* You can also choose the random color option and black gradient option
* You can choose a grid size from 8x8 to 64x64
* If an invalid grid size is chosen, an error message is display
* The error message can be clicked on to have it fade out
* You have an option to keep a trail or not (No trail means the colors stay while trail means they trail behind the mouse)
* You can reset your grid by pressing the white circle buttons on the bottom corners of the Sketch-A-Etch
* I'm Feeling Lucky button changes the color of a random element on the page to a random color
* Easter Eggs: At the moment, there is only one Easter Egg Set Piece which is triggered when there is a 8x8 grid and the I'm Feeling Lucky button is pressed

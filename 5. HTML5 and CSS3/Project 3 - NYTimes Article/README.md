# NYTimes Article Page - INCOMPLETE
A static clone of a NYTIMEs article page I made for The Odin Project.
This project has no functionality. It is only a cosmetic copy.

## Project: Positioning Elements (with the New York Times)
* Go to the [NYT article in question](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/science/space/detection-of-waves-in-space-buttresses-landmark-theory-of-big-bang.html?_r=1)  and have a look around.
* Create a blank HTML document.
* Think about all the elements on the page and how they are grouped together.
* Lay out the basic structure of the page using empty <div> elements that are appropriately sized and positioned. You may want to make their background colors different so you can see them. Don't forget to use your browser's developer tools (right click on the page, click "inspect element")!
* Set up the top navigation bar (again, don't worry about making it change when you scroll down the page). How can you get it to stick to the top of the page as you scroll down?
* Fill in and position the additional sections. Don't worry about enclosing every paragraph of text in p tags.

# Mint.com Forms
A static clone of the Mint.com sign up page I made for The Odin Project.
This project has no functionality. It is only a cosmetic copy.

## Project: HTML Forms (with Mint)
* Go to Mint.com's signup page and have a look around. The form isn't exceptionally complicated.
* Create a blank HTML document.
* Plan out how the elements on the page need to be grouped together.
* Lay out the empty <div>'s for the major sections (form, sidebar, footer...) and make them the proper size and alignment. It may be helpful to change their background colors while you're positioning them on the page. Don't forget to use your browser's developer tools (right click on the page, click "inspect element")!
* Fill in those <div> elements with the content you want to include.
* Now style them to look like the real webpage.
